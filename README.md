# What is this and why am I doing this?
I am a Machine Learning learner, a beginner. When I started learning this, I feel overwhelmed by the tons of materials on the web, like the tutorials in TensorFlow homepage, Youtube videos, books, papers. So I decided to make this repository to mark down what I have learned and how I learned. Most of them are just some notes. I will try to make them concise, so no matter if it's you or me, can have some concise and less confusing start of Machine Learning and Tensorflow.

The version of TF here is 2.2.
